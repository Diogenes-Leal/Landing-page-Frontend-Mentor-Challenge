### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've had used this project to practice flexbox and mobile-first workflow. Because of that, i've used and learned some atributes of flexbox, like justify-content, align-items, flex-direction.

Besides flex and a different workflow, i used a two new types of unity, vh and vw, and started to discover how to work properly with svg files.

### Continued development

First, i want to learn more about responsive web sites. Then, i will study more about the differences and how to use unitys (such has vh, px, vw) and i do intend to study more about svg, mobile-first workflow.
